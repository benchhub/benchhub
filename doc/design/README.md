## TODO

Random

- a knowledge base, e.g. why `bytes.LastIndexByte` is slow in go, how to optimize it, links to issue and optimization result
  - the knowledge base should be namespaced, i.e. you can have your private kb refer to the public kb
  - maybe call it bkb
- code similarity (knowledge base w/o human, well ML ...) e.g. similar code blocks that runs faster/slower
