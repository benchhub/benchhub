# 2020-01-17 Roadmap

The use cases for benchhub are still the same

- microbenchmark for a specific language, e.g. go, rust etc.
- end to end benchmark for a database, e.g. xephon-b, oltpbench, ycsb, tpc etc.

And the running environments are (based on difficulty of implementation)

- local (w/o docker. just go test -bench)
- local docker
- k8s single node (load generator & database in same pod)
- k8s multi node
- bare metal single node
- k8s cross cluster
- k8s cross cloud provider
- bare metal multi node

Will just start with the local one first, need to remove all existing code.
k8s one will be mainly developed in [benchhub-operator](https://github.com/benchhub/benchhub-operator).
Dragging k8s into go.mod is insane and I'd rather have the operator repo implements a grpc server defined in benchhub.
