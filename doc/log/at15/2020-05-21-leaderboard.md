# 2020-05-21 LeaderBoard

## Background

This is a very useful feature. There are contests, course projects that need to sort ppl based on some performance metrics.
We can also generate leader board like 10 fastest time series database this quarter (like the TIOBE most popular language, well, it's PHP).

## Design

Just put the idea here ... it should be straight forward, the complex part is associate user to result submission.
