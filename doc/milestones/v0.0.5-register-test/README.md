# v0.0.5 Register Test

## TODO

- [ ] move register test from v0.0.4 register user

## Motivation

Split from [v0.0.4 Register User](../v0.0.4-register-user). User registration logic already has enough boilerplate on databases, rpc etc.
Register test and benchmark focus more how to extract test name from test output. We may also take a bazel like approach, specify test target.
