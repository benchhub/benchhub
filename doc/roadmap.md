# Roadmap

The primary goal is to have something and finish the write up of thesis, this is called RDD (report driven development),
which is popular among students, and the curve normally reach its peak 1-2 days before the deadline, so key is to move the
deadline earlier.

Week 2

- `lib/monitor` host and process metrics using `/proc`
- use terraform to deploy to vagrant and docker? (for local testing...)

Week 3

- wait for benchboard
- use terraform to deploy to packet and AWS maybe?
- github integration (wait the `go.ice`'s `icehub` example finished)
- API for reporting metrics
  - might just scrape it? i.e. agent store result in s3 instead of directly report to central

Week 4

- YCSB
- OLTPBench

Week 5

- have the whole stuff running?....
- it's already week 5 ... but I got nothing, except a bunch of survey (as usual)
  - got a lot of achievement on steam though ...
- manually setup the machine and database (might just locally using docker)
- run the benchmark and collect the result to database

Week 6

- should have something for result in write up
