## TODO

- [x] unit test to test correctness of implementation
  - the first implementation is just a direct port of go's `MergeOnlySort`
- [ ] write benchmark
- [ ] benchmark format
- [ ] profiling using pprof? pingcap did have an [article](https://pingcap.com/blog/quickly-find-rust-program-bottlenecks-online-using-a-go-tool/) with [pprof-rs](https://github.com/tikv/pprof-rs)
